This is some code I wrote when I wanted to explore whether I could establish a convergence guarantee to a Nash equilibrium of sealed-bid first-price and second-price auctions. 

Each file consists of a basic Q-learning setup, and two separate information setups. In one case, bidders have no information about others' setups, whereas in the other case, they take into account bidding history.
